        2 States by Chetan Bhagat is a delightful, relatable, and humorous love story that explores the
        intricacies of intercultural relationships in modern India. The novel is a semi-autobiographical
        account of Bhagat’s own experience, following the journey of two young individuals from
        different states in India who fall in love while pursuing their education at IIM Ahmedabad. The
        protagonist, Krish Malhotra, hails from a Punjabi family, while his girlfriend, Ananya
        Swaminathan, is from a Tamilian Brahmin background. Their love story, full of warmth and
        humor, becomes complicated by the cultural differences, familial expectations, and the
        pressures of Indian society.<br>
        As Krish and Ananya embark on the journey of convincing their families to approve of their
        relationship, the story delves into the cultural clashes and familial dynamics that often shape
        Indian relationships. Their families have strong and opposing opinions on their marriage, and
        the couple faces numerous challenges trying to bridge the gap between two starkly different
        cultural identities. The book cleverly portrays the colorful and often chaotic nature of Indian
        families, while also highlighting the love, respect, and sacrifices that come with navigating
        cultural traditions and familial approval.<br>
        The novel touches on universal themes of love, acceptance, and the pursuit of one's own
        happiness, all while capturing the unique essence of life in contemporary India. As Krish and
        Ananya fight to make their relationship work, they learn valuable lessons about compromise,
        resilience, and the true meaning of love.<br>
