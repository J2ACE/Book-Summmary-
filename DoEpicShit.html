        Do Epic Shit by Ankur Warikoo is an inspirational and motivational book that encourages
        readers to take control of their lives and pursue their dreams with confidence and determination.
        Ankur Warikoo, a popular entrepreneur, mentor, and motivational speaker, shares his life
        lessons, experiences, and the principles that have guided him in his personal and professional
        journey. The book serves as a guide for young individuals trying to navigate their careers,
        relationships, and personal growth.<br>
        The central theme of the book revolves around the idea that life is short, and in order to make it
        meaningful, one must take risks, chase their passions, and embrace failures as learning
        opportunities. Ankur talks about the importance of living with purpose, breaking free from
        societal expectations, and creating a life that aligns with one’s true desires. The book is packed
        with personal anecdotes, practical advice, and actionable insights that motivate readers to step
        out of their comfort zones and do things that truly matter to them.<br>
        Throughout the book, Ankur emphasizes the importance of resilience, self-awareness, and
        embracing uncertainty. He urges readers to redefine success on their own terms, rather than
        following conventional paths or living up to the standards set by society. The message is clear:
        do things that scare you, make mistakes, and keep pushing forward, because that’s how you’ll
        truly do epic things in life.<br>
        Thematic Elements:<br>

        society imposes, advocating instead for a life led by passion, curiosity, and the courage to fail.
