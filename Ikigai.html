        Ikigai: The Japanese Secret to a Long and Happy Life by Héctor García and Francesc Miralles is a captivating exploration of the Japanese concept of ikigai, or “reason for being.” This concept, deeply rooted in Japanese culture, combines one’s passions, talents, values, and the needs of the world to create a sense of purpose and meaning in life. The book delves into the philosophy of ikigai, which emphasizes that finding purpose in life leads to greater happiness, health, and longevity.<br>

The authors travel to Okinawa, Japan, which is known for its high population of centenarians, to understand how the principles of ikigai contribute to their long and happy lives. They examine lifestyle habits, community connections, diets, and daily routines of Okinawan residents, and how these elements foster resilience, contentment, and well-being. The book suggests that ikigai lies at the intersection of four key elements:
<br>
What you love<br>
What you are good<br> at
What the world needs<br>
What you can be paid for<br>
By balancing these elements, one can achieve fulfillment and live with greater satisfaction. Rather than focusing on retirement or working for material gain, the book promotes a lifestyle where small, meaningful actions and continuous growth bring true joy. García and Miralles illustrate how anyone, regardless of age or background, can begin the journey to discover their ikigai.
