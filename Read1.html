            The Monk Who Sold His Ferrari by Robin Sharma is an inspiring fable about pursuing life’s
            true purpose and discovering inner peace. It follows Julian Mantle, a high-flying lawyer whose
            relentless drive for success and wealth leads him to a health crisis, prompting him to reconsider
            everything he values. Faced with a wake-up call, Julian sells off his luxurious possessions,
            including his beloved Ferrari, and sets out on a spiritual journey to the Himalayas. There, he
            encounters the Sages of Sivana, a community of enlightened monks who live in harmony and
            have unlocked the secrets to lasting happiness and fulfillment.<br>
            In the Himalayas, Julian undergoes a profound transformation as he learns the wisdom and
            habits that will shape his future. His experiences and teachings are revealed as a guide for
            readers, focusing on seven virtues that bring clarity, inner peace, and a sense of purpose.
            Returning to share his newfound insights, Julian imparts lessons on mindfulness, mastering
            one’s thoughts, and creating a life driven by meaning rather than material success. He
            encourages readers to adopt practices like meditation, goal-setting, and positive thinking to find
            joy and harmony in their own lives. Through Julian’s story, Sharma presents a compelling path
            to inner transformation and contentment.<br>
