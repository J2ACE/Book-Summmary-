    The 3 Mistakes of My Life by Chetan Bhagat follows three friends—Govind, Ishaan, and
    Omi—whose aspirations and friendships are tested amidst the vibrant yet challenging
    environment of modern-day Ahmedabad, India. Govind Patel, the practical and ambitious
    entrepreneur, yearns to break free from his humble roots. He sees a future in business and
    persuades his two closest friends to join him in opening a sports shop. Ishaan, the passionate
    cricket fan and former athlete, dreams of nurturing young talent, while Omi, easygoing and
    supportive, joins the venture despite his family’s deep political ties. As the trio throws
    themselves into their goals, they each bring different strengths and challenges to the venture,
    highlighting the complexity of pursuing dreams in a world fraught with personal and social
    pressures.<br>
    As the story unfolds, the friends confront personal mistakes, unexpected betrayals, and the
    harsh realities of communal conflicts that threaten to destroy their dreams. The novel moves
    through both lighthearted and intense moments, intertwining each character’s journey with the

    will affect their futures and their friendship. The title reflects the core of the story—three
    “mistakes” that change the course of Govind’s life, offering readers a glimpse into the
    bittersweet nature of ambition, love, and regret.<br>
